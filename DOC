For this project, we implemented a the driver for the ext2 file system in a read only mode.  The file system works by
classifying files with named inodes and provides simple operations to retreive them and act on them.

For the extra credit, we also modified ext2cat to support files that use indirect blocks. After all direct blocks are
loaded, the program then checks if the bytes_read is less than the size of the file. Originally, ext2cat would truncate
files that were too large to fit entirely in direct blocks. To load the data stored in indirect blocks we took the
process used to load the direct blocks and modified it to iterate through the indirect blocks until the entire size of
the file has been read. We added one pointer to the first indirect block and another to the next indirect block, which
we incremented as we iterated through the blocks.
